Controlling Assistant or Sending Preset Commands Using IR Remote
------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect the IR Receiver according to the wiring diagram given below.

.. figure:: ../docs/_static/images/IRWiring.jpg
    :align: center
    :scale: 40%
    :target: ../docs/_static/images/IRWiring.jpg

.. note:: The diagram given is for GPIO 17, if you are using another GPIO, please make the suitable changes to the connection.

2. Run the sample IR receiver script to get the codes for your desired buttons::

      python /home/${USER}/GassistPi/Extras/IR-Sensor.py

3. In the config.yaml under IR, list your codes and corresponding queries/actions. The number of queries should match the number of codes listed.

4. If you want to execute the custom actions like Spotify, YouTube playback, Domoticz Control etc, prefix the word custom.

   Eg::

       custom Play God's Plan from Youtube
       custom Turn On _Domoticz-device-name__
       custom Play all the songs from Google Music

5. If you are sending a command to be processed by google assistant, there is no need to prefix custom.

   Eg::

       what is the time
       what can you do for me

 **Video for reference:**

   .. raw:: html

       <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em;">
       <iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlbcjkRuQZk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
       </div>



Sending Commands or Queries to Google Assistant Over MQTT
------------------------------------------------------

1. Set up your desired MQTT broker.
   If you are setting up Raspberry Pi as a MQTT broker, follow the guide below.

   .. raw:: html

       <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em;">
       <iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ce2Djxx9shU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
       </div>

2. Enter the MQTT broker credentials and subscription topic in the provided config.yaml file.
3. Set the **MQTT_Control** to **Enabled**.
4. Now, you can send queries or commands to google assistant over MQTT.

Custom Conversations
----------------------------

1. Customize the assistant's reply to a specific question.
2. Add the list of questions and answers in config.yaml under the **Conversation**: option.
3. **There must be only one question, but corresponding answers can be as many**.
4. Sample questions and answers has been provided, please follow the same pattern.



Custom Wakeword Activation
----------------------------

1. You can choose to either Enable or Disable the custom wakeword activation in the config.yaml file.
2. In the config.yaml file, under Wakewords, change the **"Custom_Wakeword"** to **'Enabled'** if you want to use the custom wakeword or set it to 'Disabled' if you dont want to use the custom wakeword option.
3. You have a choice between Snowboy and Picovoice for the custom wakeword engine.
4. For Snowboy, change **"Wakeword_Engine"** to **Snowboy** and for Picovoice, change **"Wakeword_Engine"** to **Picovoice**.
5. For changes to take effect, you need to restart the assistant. Changing status while an instance of assistant is already running will not cause any change.
6. Create your custom snowboy model here_. Add the models to **/GassistPi/src/resources/snowboy_models** directory.
.. _here: https://snowboy.kitt.ai
7. Sample Snowboy and Picovoice models have been provided and placed in the /GassistPi/src/resources/ folder. Set your desired models by setting their paths in the config.yaml file.
8. To disable the default **"Ok Google"** hotword, set the Ok_Google option to **"Disabled"**.

.. note:: If you turn off the default **Ok Google** wakeword/hotword, everytime you invoke the assistant using the custom wakeword, you will get a prompt for the Mic being turned Off and On.

9. Users using pushbutton.py or Pi Zero users have an option between using custom wakeword and GPIO trigerring. If custom wakeword is enabled, then GPIO trigger will not work. To enable GPIO triggering, set custom wakeword to 'Disabled'.



Playing Spotify Playlist
----------------------------

.. note:: Spotify API currently only supports playback in a web browser, but DRM content is being blocked in the Raspberry Pi. As a roundabout approach, I have programmed the assistant to get the playlist details using Spotipy API and then fetch those tracks from YouTube. This custom program has a better accuracy than spotify playlist playback using mpsyt.
          This feature uses a YouTube Data API v3. Click here_ for guidelines to add YouTube Data API to the project and to generate the required key.
.. _here: https://gassistpi-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#adding-youtube-data-api-and-generating-api-key
