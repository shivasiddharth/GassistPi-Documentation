Controlling Assistant or Sending Preset Commands Using IR Remote
------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect the IR Receiver according to the wiring diagram given below.

.. figure:: ../docs/_static/images/IRWiring.jpg
    :align: center
    :scale: 40%
    :target: ../docs/_static/images/IRWiring.jpg

.. note:: The diagram given is for GPIO 17, if you are using another GPIO, please make the suitable changes to the connection.

2. Run the sample IR receiver script to get the codes for your desired buttons::

      python /home/${USER}/GassistPi/Extras/IR-Sensor.py

3. In the config.yaml under IR, list your codes and corresponding queries/actions. The number of queries should match the number of codes listed.

4. If you want to execute the custom actions like Spotify, YouTube playback, Domoticz Control etc, prefix the word custom.

   Eg::

       custom Play God's Plan from Youtube
       custom Turn On _Domoticz-device-name__
       custom Play all the songs from Google Music

5. If you are sending a command to be processed by google assistant, there is no need to prefix custom.

   Eg::

       what is the time
       what can you do for me

 **Video for reference:**
