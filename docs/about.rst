About this project
*******************   

.. note::   
 Developments have been stopped and this project is no longer maintained.      


In May of 2017, Google Released it's AIY Projects kit. Initially not many had access to it, so that is when I started modifying the Google Assistant SDK adding AIY like features to help out the ones left without the kit.

Every project requires a name and so I named it GassistPi ("G"oogle "Assist"ant on "Pi").

Fast forwarding to date, the project works not only on Pi boards but on a number of other platforms (checkout the supported platforms page_ for more details).

It has some interesting custom actions for both entertainment and home-automation needs. Primary language of coding is Python and the project has been structed in a way to allow even inexperienced programmers to modify existing codes and implement their own custom actions.

This is a project for the single board community community, driven by the community.
