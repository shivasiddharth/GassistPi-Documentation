About this project
==================

In May of 2017, Google Released their AIY Projects kit. Initially not many had access to it, so that is when I started modifying the Google Assistant SDK adding AIY like features. Every project requires a name and so I named it GassistPi ("G"oogle "Assist"ant on "Pi"). Fast forwarding to date, the project works not only on Pi boards but on a number of other platforms (checkout the supported platforms page_ for more details). It has some interesting custom actions for both entertainment and home-automation needs. Primary language of coding is Python and the project has been structed in a way to allow even inexperienced programmers to modify and implement their own custom actions. This is a project for the single board community community, driven by the community.
